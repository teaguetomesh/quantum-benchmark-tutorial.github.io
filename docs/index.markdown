title: "ISCA '22 Tutorial: Scalable Quantum Benchmarking"
---

The goal of this tutorial is to:
1. Provide an overview of the current quantum benchmarking landscape.
2. Introduce [SupermarQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11045), a new quantum benchmarking suite recently published in [HPCA 2022](https://hpca-conf.org/2022/program/#session4c).
3. Walk attendees through a hands-on demo of generating benchmarks, evaluating them on hardware, and processing the results.
4. Show users how they can develop and design their own quantum benchmarks.

# SupermarQ
SupermarQ is a scalable, application-oriented, quantum benchmark suite. It is based on collaborative research between Princeton University, The University of Chicago, Super.tech, and Northwestern University. This work was recently published in [HPCA 2022](https://hpca-conf.org/2022/program/#session4c) and an open source version is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11045). More information on SupermarQ can be found on the [Super.tech website](https://www.super.tech/supermarq/), and our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SupertechLabs/SupermarQ).
